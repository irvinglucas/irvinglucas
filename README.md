<h1 align="center">Hello, world! üëã</h1>

My name is Irving Lucas. I'm from Macei√≥ - Alagoas - Brazil. I'm proud of been of northeast side from Brazil!


I'm a bachelor in Computer Science. I'm a scientist! ü§ì

I like to introduce myself as a tech enthusiast. I like to be arround technology, read tech news and have all kind of gadgets that make world's life better and better.


## Current focus

My professional carrer as a software engineer started in 2023. Today I work as an Android OS framework engineer. 

I build things to run into Android operating system architecture, specifically in the OS [Framework Layer](https://developer.android.com/guide/platform#api-framework). I am responsible to write/refactor code to create/maintain security features for Android Enterprise 

I attended an Android specialization program, focused on Android apps and embedded android development. This program was offered for Venturus, the company that now I work for.


## Last professional experience

Previously, I was working at CONFIGR as a Technical Linux Support Engineer. The day to day of this job was to give tech support in linux cloud environments and web applications hosted on cloud environment provided by the company itself. The job required knowledge on Linux cloud servers management, webservers management like NGINX, LiteSpeed, as well as DBMS management, like MariaDB, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Working remotely, I've developed capabilities of managing cloud servers, as well as web apps set up and maintenance in those cloud servers! I worked doing tech support to the clients through an appropriate ticket channel, solving eventual conflicts between apps and the server/services.
