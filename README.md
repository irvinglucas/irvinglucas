<h1 align="center">Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Irving Lucas. I'm from MaceiÃ³ - Alagoas - Brazil. I'm proud of been of northeast side from Brazil!


I'm a bachelor in Computer Science. I'm a scientist! ðŸ¤“


## Current focus


Currently i'm at a career transition. Now my journey is to be an Android developer ðŸ¤“ My study is focused on developing native apps using Java/Kotlin and the latest tools and techniques.

I love technology. The Android world conquered me since I was at my first year in college until today. So I decided to focus on mobile development, and my first step is native development.

In the future I seek to focus on market trends technologies like Flutter. Flutter is widely used to develop hybrid apps(iOS/Android).


## Last professional experience

Previously, I was working at CONFIGR as a Technical Linux Support Engineer. The day of this job was to give tech support in linux cloud environments and web applications hosted on cloud. The job required knowledge on webservers management like NGINX, LiteSpeed, as well as DB server management, like MariaDB, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Working remotely, I've developed capabilities of managing cloud servers, as well as web apps set up and maintenance in those cloud servers! I worked doing tech support to the clients through an appropriate ticket channel, solving eventual conflicts between apps and the server/services
