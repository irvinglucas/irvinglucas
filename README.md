<h1 align="center">Hello, world! üëã</h1>

My name is Irving Lucas. I'm from Macei√≥ - Alagoas - Brazil. I'm proud of been of northeast side from Brazil!


I'm a bachelor in Computer Science. I'm a scientist! ü§ì

I like to categorize me as a tech enthusiast. I like to be arround technology, read tech news and to have all kind of gadgets that get the world's life better and better.


## Current focus


Currently I'm in a career transition. Now my journey is to be an Android developer ü§ì My study is focused on developing native apps using Kotlin with the latest and coolest tools and techniques to achieve the best results!

I love technology. The Android world conquered me since I was at my first year in college until today. So I decided to focus on mobile development, and my first step is native development. üì≤

I think that native development is, for me, the best choice to start because I like to know how things work in its root. Beside of that, I also know that things have to be easier to develop sometimes. Thus, in the future, I'll go forward in hybrid development, because this way I'll be more prepared for future challenges that might come üòÅ

<!-- In the future I'll seek to focus on market trends technologies like Flutter. Flutter is widely used to develop hybrid apps(iOS/Android). -->


## Last professional experience

Previously, I was working at CONFIGR as a Technical Linux Support Engineer. The day to day of this job was to give tech support in linux cloud environments and web applications hosted on cloud environment provided by the company itself. The job required knowledge on Linux cloud servers management, webservers management like NGINX, LiteSpeed, as well as DBMS management, like MariaDB, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Working remotely, I've developed capabilities of managing cloud servers, as well as web apps set up and maintenance in those cloud servers! I worked doing tech support to the clients through an appropriate ticket channel, solving eventual conflicts between apps and the server/services.
