<h1 align="center">Hello, world! üëã</h1>

My name is Irving Lucas. I'm from the city of Macei√≥, located in the state of Alagoas - Brazil.


I'm a bachelor in Computer Science. I'm a scientist! ü§ì

I like to put myself as a tech enthusiast. I like to be arround technology, read tech news and have
all kinds of gadgets that make world's life better.


## Current focus

My professional carrer as a software engineer started in 2023. Today I work as an Android OS
framework engineer. 

I build things to run in the Android operating system, specifically in the OS [Framework
Layer](https://developer.android.com/guide/platform#api-framework). I'm responsible for
writing/refactoring code to create/maintain security features for Android Enterprise 

I attended an Android specialization program, focused on Android apps and embedded android
development. This program was offered for Venturus, the company that now I work for.


## Last professional experience

Previously, I was working at CONFIGR as a Technical Linux Support Engineer. The workday of this job
was to give tech support in linux cloud environments and backend web applications hosted on cloud
environment provided by the company itself. The job required knowledge on Linux cloud servers
management, webservers management like NGINX, LiteSpeed, as well as DBMS management, like MariaDB,
PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Working remotely, I've developed capabilities of managing cloud servers, as
well as web apps set up and maintenance in those cloud servers! I worked doing tech support to the
clients through an appropriate ticket channel, solving eventual conflicts between apps and the
server/services.
